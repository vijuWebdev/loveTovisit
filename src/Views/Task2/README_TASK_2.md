# Task 2 - Create a Button Component

## Instructions

The goal of this task is to create a **Button** component in React that allows the developer to generate buttons of
types: `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Tertiary`, and `Disabled`. The component should be reusable,
maintainable, and follow a clean structure.

### Requirements

- The Button API should be customizable using props.
- Style each button type differently for a clear visual distinction between them.
