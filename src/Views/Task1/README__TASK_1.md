# Task 1 - Responsive Layout

## Instructions

Your task is to style the provided layout to be fully responsive in a **mobil-first approach**. The design should adapt
as follows:

1. **Mobil (Small Screens)**: Display all elements in a single column.
2. **Tablet View (768px and above)**: Transition the layout to two columns.
3. **Medium Desktop View (1024px and above)**: Transition the layout to three columns.
4. **Large Desktop View (1280px and above)**: Transition the layout to four columns.

### Requirements

- The layout must scale seamlessly between these breakpoints.
- Ensure consistent spacing and alignment of elements.
- Avoid overlapping or breaking of the layout at any screen size.
- Both the header and footer should remain visually distinct from the main content regardless of the screen size.
- **Header Content**:
    - The header should indicate the active screen type based on the current breakpoint.
    - For example:
        - Display “Header Mobile” on small screens.
        - Display “Header Tablet” on tablets (768px and above).
        - Display “Header Small Desktop” on medium desktop screens (1024px and above).
        - Display “Header Large Desktop” on large desktop screens (1280px and above).
